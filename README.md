# ARIMA-Model-Stock-Price-Prediction

## Stock Price Forecasting with ARIMA

## Overview
This repository provides a detailed approach to forecasting stock prices using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Given the complexity and dynamic nature of financial markets, forecasting stock prices is a challenging yet vital task. This project showcases the implementation, evaluation, and potential enhancements to the ARIMA-based forecasting.

## Contents
Dataset: Contains historical stock price data that serves as the basis for the ARIMA model.
Python Script: Implementation of the ARIMA model, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and forecasting.
Report: A comprehensive analysis of the results, evaluation of the model's assumptions, and recommendations for future improvements.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Rigorous cleaning and preprocessing of stock price data to make it suitable for time-series forecasting.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed analysis to understand underlying patterns and structures in the data.
ARIMA Forecasting: Predicting stock prices using the ARIMA model, identified by its parameters (p, d, and q).
Model Evaluation: In-depth analysis of model residuals, including properties like autocorrelation and kurtosis, to verify the model's assumptions and effectiveness.
Results
Preliminary results indicate that, despite the inherent volatility of financial markets, the ARIMA model performs reasonably well in predicting stock values.

## Future Work

- **Enhanced ARIMA (SARIMAX model)**: Incorporating more explanatory variables to improve prediction accuracy.
  
- **Alternative Forecasting Models**: Experimenting with diverse forecasting models to determine the most effective approach.

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Evaluating machine learning methodologies to potentially enhance prediction performance.

- **Critical Review**: Insightful feedback on the current work's limitations, and areas of potential development in the domain of predictive models for finance.
